# StructuredDPP

A project to implement a structured determinental point process from Kulesza and Tuscar \[2009\]. A DPP is a probability distribution that selectes a subset of a bigger set and encodes the idea that similar items in the subset "repel" each other. The structure comes from a way of splitting the items in the subset up into variables with associated factors. We then use message passing and second order semirings to efficiently work with complex DPPs.
